Once there was a tree. . .

and she loved a little boy.

And every day the boy would come

and he would gather her leaves and

make them into crown and play king of the forest.

He would climb up her trunk and

swing from her branches and eat

apples. And they would play

hide-and-go-seek. And when he was

tired, he would sleep in her shade.

And the boy loved the tree. . . very

much. And the tree was happy.
